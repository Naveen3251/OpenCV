# Introduction
In this code, the main concept is to control the system volume using hand gestures. The code utilizes the `pycaw` library to interact with the system's audio endpoint volume. 

The `HandTrackingModule` is used to detect and track hand landmarks in the webcam feed. By measuring the distance between the thumb and index finger landmarks, the code calculates the length of the hand. 

The hand length is then mapped to a desired volume range using interpolation. The calculated volume is set using the `volume.SetMasterVolumeLevel()` function from `pycaw`. 

The volume level is visualized by a bar on the screen, which corresponds to the hand length. The volume percentage is also displayed on the screen. 

By moving the hand closer or farther, the user can control the system volume in a touchless manner. The code also displays the frames per second (FPS) to monitor the performance of the application.
