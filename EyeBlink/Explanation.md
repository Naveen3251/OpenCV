# Introduction
The provided code captures a video, detects faces using face mesh detection, and calculates the average ratio between specific points on the face to determine if the eye is open or closed,
tracking and displaying the blink count in real-time.

# Code Explanation

**Video Capture:**

- The code initializes a video capture using OpenCV to read frames from the "EyeBlink.mp4" video file.
- The captured video is assigned to the variable `cap`.

**Face Detection:**

- The code initializes a `FaceMeshDetector` object from the `cvzone.FaceMeshModule` module with a maximum of one face to detect.
- Inside the while loop, it reads frames from the video capture using `cap.read()`.
- The `findFaceMesh` method of the `FaceMeshDetector` object is called to detect face meshes in the frame.
- The method returns the modified image (`img`) and the detected faces (`faces`).

**Stack Images:**

- The code resizes the image (`img`) to a width of 640 pixels and a height of 480 pixels using `cv2.resize()`.
- The `cvzone.stackImages` function is used to vertically stack two images: the resized image (`img`) and the plot image (`imgPlot`) generated by the `plotY` object.
- The stacked images are assigned to the variable `stackImages`.

**Ratio Average between Points to Verify the Closing or Opening of the Eye:**

- The code defines a list of eye points IDs called `idList`.
- Inside the while loop, if a face is detected (`if faces:`), the code retrieves the first detected face (`face = faces[0]`).
- For each ID in the `idList`, a circle is drawn on the image at the corresponding face point (`cv2.circle(img, face[id], 2, (255, 0, 255), cv2.FILLED)`).
- The distances between specific points on the face (`leftUP`, `leftDown`, `leftLeft`, `leftRight`) are calculated using the `findDistance` method of the `FaceMeshDetector` object.
- Lines are drawn on the image to connect the specific points (`cv2.line(img, leftUP, leftDown, (0, 255, 0), 1)` and `cv2.line(img, leftLeft, leftRight, (0, 255, 0), 1)`).
- The ratio is calculated as the division of the vertical distance by the horizontal distance, multiplied by 100.
- The ratio value is appended to the `ratioList`.
- If the length of `ratioList` exceeds 3, the oldest ratio value is removed using `ratioList.pop(0)`.
- The average of the ratio values is calculated as `ratioAvg = sum(ratioList) / len(ratioList)`.
- If the `ratioAvg` is below 35 and the `frameCount` is 0, it indicates a blink, and the `blinkCounter` is incremented. The `frameCount` is set to 1 to prevent multiple counts for the same blink.
- The `frameCount` is incremented until it reaches 10, and then it is set back to 0 to allow for counting the next blink.
- The `cvzone.putTextRect` function is used to display the blink count on the image.

This way, the code calculates the average ratio between specific points on the face to determine if the eye is open or closed based on a threshold.
It keeps track of the blink count and displays it on the image.
