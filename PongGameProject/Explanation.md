# Introduction
The code utilizes computer vision techniques and libraries such as OpenCV and cvzone to create interactive applications. 
It demonstrates functionalities such as hand tracking, overlaying images, and real-time score display in the context of a Pong game.

# Code Explanation

**Overlay Background Image:**

- The code reads and assigns the images `imgBackGround`, `imgGameOver`, `imgBall`, `imgPaddle_1`, and `imgPaddle_2` from the specified file paths.
- These images will be used as overlays in the game.

**Use Hand Tracking Module:**

- The code imports the **`HandDetector`** class from the **`cvzone.HandTrackingModule`** module.
- The `HandDetector` class is used to detect and track hands in the video stream.

**Create a Detector:**

- The code initializes a `HandDetector` object named `detector` with specific parameters.
- The **`detectionCon`** parameter determines the detection confidence threshold for hand detection.
- The **`maxHands`** parameter specifies the maximum number of hands to detect.

**Hand Tracking:**

- Inside the main loop, the code reads frames from the video capture using `cap.read()`.
- The captured image is flipped horizontally using `cv2.flip()` to provide a mirrored view.
- The flipped image is copied to `iAm` for display purposes.
- The `findHands` method of the `detector` object is called to detect hands in the image.
- The method returns the hand information in the `hands` variable and the modified image with drawn landmarks.
- The detected hands are looped over, and based on the hand type ('Left' or 'Right'), the corresponding paddle image is overlaid on the image using `cvzone.overlayPNG()`.
- If the ball hits the paddle, the ball's horizontal speed is reversed, and the score is incremented accordingly.

**Move the Ball:**

- The code checks if the ball has crossed the boundary **(`ballPos[0] < 30` or `ballPos[0] > 1200`)**.
- If the boundary is crossed, the `gameOver` flag is set to True.
- If `gameOver` is True, the `imgGameOver` image is displayed with the total score.
- If `gameOver` is False, the ball's position is updated based on the speed (`speedX` and `speedY`).
- The ball is overlaid on the image using `cvzone.overlayPNG()`, and the scores are displayed using `cv2.putText()`.

**Display Score:**

- The image captured by the webcam is resized and displayed in a specific region of the final image using array slicing.
- The scores for the left and right players are displayed using `cv2.putText()`.

This way, the code creates a Pong game using hand tracking to control the paddles and displays the score in real-time.
