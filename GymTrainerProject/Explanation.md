# Introduction
This gym trainer project utilizes pose detection to track and count dumbbell curls during a workout. 
It captures video from a webcam, detects the user's pose, and calculates the angle of their arm. 
The angle is then used to visualize a progress bar representing the curling motion. 
The project also keeps track of the number of curls completed and displays it on the screen. 
It provides real-time feedback to the user, helping them maintain proper form and track their exercise progress. 
This interactive and engaging system can serve as a virtual gym trainer, assisting users in their fitness routines and motivating them to achieve their fitness goals.
